Works Ministry needs RM387 million to repair slopes nationwide
TEMERLOH: An estimated allocation of RM387 million is required to repair 531 collapsed slopes across the country, said Works Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi.

He said the damaged slopes consist of small, medium and large-scale cases which were a result of continues downpour, floods and other natural disasters.

"All the states including Sabah and Sarawak have recorded collapse slope incidents. The most affected states include Pahang and Perak, which have a lot of highland areas.

"We have identified the slopes that require repairs and the ministry needs the budget to execute the necessary mitigation works," he told reporters after inspecting the new stretch on the Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah bridge construction site here today.

Meanwhile, Nanta said 56 collapsed slopes have been identified along Jalan Kuala Lumpur-Bentong and three sections namely Section 47, Section 42 and Section 57 along the stretch were currently undergoing repairs at a total estimated cost of RM6 million.

"There are another 53 slopes along Jalan Kuala Lumpur - Bentong that require repair with a cost of RM51 million. The ministry does not have sufficient budget to carry out repair works along the entire stretch," he said.

On the progress of the ongoing construction works at the Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah bridge, Nanta said it has reached 86 per cent and will be opened for road users on Aug 31.

He said the RM102 million project to upgrade the single-lane bridge to a dual-carriageway will help ease the bottleneck traffic congestion on the existing old bridge, especially during peak hours.
