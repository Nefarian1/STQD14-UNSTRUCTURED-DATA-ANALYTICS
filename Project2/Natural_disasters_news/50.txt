KUALA BERANG: The Puteri Umno movement is setting up its volunteer squads in all states to help victims affected by disasters, including floods.

Its leader Datuk Nurul Amal Mohd Fauzi said the setting up of the volunteer squads was to enable assistance to disaster victims to be perfectly planned and distributed effectively.

She said the movement has about 300,000 members nationwide who can be mobilised to the affected states as volunteers.

"Before this, we (Puteri Umno) do not have special disaster squads. We mobilised our volunteers to disaster-affected areas according to the situation, but with the establishment of this squad, if an unexpected natural disaster occurs, we have volunteers in every state to help the local community," she said.
