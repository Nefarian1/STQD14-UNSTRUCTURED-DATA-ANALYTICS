Life Will Change

It's not a game
I'm not a robot AI challenging you
I'm not a phantom
I'm in your face and
I'm here to see it through
Right before your eyes
Watch us multiply
"Come to claim our rights, it's time"
As our power grows
Tryin' to stop us shows
(You) Might as well go try 'n' stop time
So you know that we're out there
Swatting lies in the making
Can't move fast without breaking
Can't hold on or life won't change
"And our voices ring out, yeah"
Took the mask off to feel free
Fought it out in the debris
Now we know that life will change
Ain't it a shame
I'm not a figment of your ailing old mind
I'm just as real as
I'm just as dangerous
"As you, so know you'll find"
A taste of your own meds
Fire in every breath
"Fire inside your head, your heart"
And as your crippled brain
Tries to fight in vain
Your empire will fall apart
And you'll know we were out there
Swatted lies in the making
Your empire for the taking
Can't hold on or life won't change
"And our voices rang out, here"
Took the mask off to feel free
Fought it out in the debris
Now we know that life will change
